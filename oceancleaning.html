        A whopping 2 million plastic bags are used every minute worldwide
        Single-use plastics are illegal in some parts of the world
        Every minute of every day a truckload of plastic is dumped into the ocean
        73% of beach litter worldwide is plastic
        One million plastic bottles are bought every minute
        There could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050  
        Up to 95% of plastic polluting oceans is carried by 10
        99% of seabirds will be eating plastic by 2050
        The average person eats 70,000 microplastics each year
        The average time that a plastic bag is used is just 12 minutes
        Over the past 50 years, world plastic production has doubled.

Chlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources, and also the ecosystem. This can cause a range of potentially harmful effects on the species that drink the water.

Recycling one ton of plastic saves the equivalent of 1,000 to 2,000 gallons of gasoline. One ton of plastic is around 25,000 plastic bottles. The production of plastic uses around 8% of the world's oil production. 90% of the trash floating in our oceans is made of plastic, around 46,000 pieces per square mile.

Polluting the ocean means adding materials or substances that makes the ocean dirty. Most ocean pollutants come from land. Marine debris, in the form of plastics and other solid trash, threatens wildlife. People can take simple steps to prevent ocean pollution, such as recycling and using less plastic.

Plastic pollution was first noticed in the ocean by scientists carrying out plankton studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and oceans and beaches still receive most of the attention of those studying and working to abate plastic pollution.

        Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic. They also suffer from lacerations, infections, reduced ability to swim, and internal injuries.

The Mediterranean is probably the most polluted ocean in the world. The United Nations Environment Programme has estimated that 650,000,000 tons of sewage, 129,000 tons of mineral oil, 60,000 tons of mercury, 3,800 tons of lead and 36,000 tons of phosphates are dumped into the Mediterranean each year.

Conserve Water. Use less water so excess runoff and wastewater will not flow into the ocean.
Reduce Pollutants. Choose nontoxic chemicals and dispose of herbicides, pesticides, and cleaning products properly.
Reduce Waste. Cut down on what you throw away.
